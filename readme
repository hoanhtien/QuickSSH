<h1>quick-ssh</h1>

Quick-ssh helps you quickly ssh to Amazon EC2 instances using the instances' name or just part of the instances' name (keyword). As a result, you no longer need to remember any ip address, public/private key (pem file), and username.

<h2>HOW TO USE</h2>

Just one command: ./quick-ssh.sh <keyword>

If there are more than one matches, quick-ssh reports all matching servers:

Tien@hoanhtien-pc:~/quick-ssh$ ./quick-ssh.sh tcloud
Multiple matches: ["tCloudWebsiteDev", "tCloudWebsiteProd", "tCloudWebsiteTest", "tcloud_trainer"]

If there is exacly one match, quick-ssh ssh you to the matching server:

Tien@hoanhtien-pc:~/quick-ssh$ ./quick-ssh.sh tcloud_train
1 match is found: {"name": "tcloud_trainer", "instance type": "m3.2xlarge", "state": "running", "ssh_private_key": "akeerthiKey", "public_dns_name": "ec2-54-224-104-18.compute-1.amazonaws.com", "id": "i-4c48242b"}
ssh -i /cygdrive/e/workspace/pem/ubuntu.pem root@ec2-54-224-104-18.compute-1.amazonaws.com
ec2Unix: /root>

Of course, ssh to a non-running server will not work:

Tien@hoanhtien-pc:~/quick-ssh$ ./quick-ssh.sh gpu
1 match is found: {"name": "GPU Instance Ondemand", "instance type": "cg1.4xlarge", "state": "stopped", "ssh_private_key": "lusongkey", "public_dns_name": "", "id": "i-68fcc909"}
Error: Not a running instance.

Quick-ssh.sh can be run at any directory. You do not have to "cd quick-ssh" all the times.

Tien@hoanhtien-pc:~/graymatics/test$ ../../quick-ssh/quick-ssh.sh redis
Multiple matches: ["2g3c-Redis-Server", "2g3c-redis-test"]

INSTALLATION

Nothing special, just need to get a copy of quick-ssh folder. You will need python (version 2.7.x or above) with boto installed beforehand.

CONFIGURATION

Input your configuration in file settings.py. By default, quick-ssh looks for pem files in directory quick-ssh/pem_files. Copy your pem files to this directory and you should be ready to go. If you get error "Permisson denined (public key)", "chmod 600" all these pem files might help.
